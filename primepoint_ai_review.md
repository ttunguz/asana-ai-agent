   - Automatically links every detail (door tags, equipment specs, finish schedules) to corresponding drawings & specifications
   - Creates "construction knowledge graph"
   - Enables instant traceability

2. **AI Assistant ("Ask Marvin")**
   - Natural language queries (e.g., "Show me all fire-rated doors on level 3")
   - Answers traceable to exact drawing details or spec section references
   - Eliminates manual document hunting

3. **Constructability Review**
   - Flags design conflicts before field problems occur
   - Reduces manual review from weeks to instant analysis
   - Example conflicts: dimension mismatches, missing specs, incompatible materials

4. **Automated Submittal Review**
   - First-pass product data review as submittals arrive from trade partners
   - Validates against specifications automatically
   - Accelerates approval workflows

### Technical Differentiation

**Multimodal AI Core:**
- Reads both visual (drawings) & text (specifications) simultaneously
- Likely leverages Bourdev's computer vision expertise from Facebook AI
- Goes beyond simple OCR or text parsing

**Audit Trail Architecture:**
- Every AI answer links to source document & page
- Critical for construction industry (liability, disputes, compliance)
- Builds trust in AI recommendations

**Integration Strategy:**

## Traction & Metrics ⭐⭐? (Data Needed)

### Reported Metrics
- **ARR:** ~$338K (need confirmation)
- **Founded:** 2024 (very early)
- **Stealth Period:** 21 months total
- **Known Investor:** NextView Ventures

### Calculated Metrics
- **Valuation Multiple:** ~118x ARR ($40M post / $338K ARR)
- **Burn Rate:** Unknown (6-person team = likely $1M-1.5M annual burn)
- **Runway:** If raising $4M at current burn = 2-3 years

### Critical Missing Metrics
- **Customer Count:** How many paying customers?
- **Customer Profiles:** GCs, architects, owners, or subcontractors?
- **Average Contract Value (ACV):** $338K ARR / X customers = ?
- **Sales Cycle:** How long from first meeting to close?
- **Net Dollar Retention (NDR):** Are customers expanding usage?
- **Pipeline:** What's the qualified pipeline for next 6-12 months?

### VCBench Context
- **51.8% Score** = REVIEW (above 40% TRACK threshold)
- **"Insufficient Data" Flag** suggests:
  - Very early metrics
  - Limited public traction signals
  - Short operating history

**What likely helped VCBench score:**
- ✅ Elite founder (prior exit to Apple)
